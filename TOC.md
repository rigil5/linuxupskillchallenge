# Overview of the Linux Upskill Challenge

## Day 1 

Starting with `ssh`-ing in and some simple commands like: `ls`, `uptime`, `free`, `df -h`, `uname -a`. Extensions on doing passwordless login with public keys and and an `ssh` config file.

## Day 2
Basic navigation, the "man" pages, file hierarchy

## Day 3 
Working with `sudo`, `uptime`, `timezones`, changing your hostname

## Day 4
Usinging 'apt' to find and install sotware. Use of `mc` to explore the filesystem. Looking at the contents of: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and `/var/log/auth.log`

## Day 5
Using `more`, `less` and navigating in these. Dotfiles, history, tab completion, and using the `nano` txt editor

## Day 6
Learning `vim`, the minimal knowledge, but also via `vimtutor`

## Day 7
Installing Apache2, stopping and starting, altering the content, reading logs

## Day 8
Hands-on with text tools like `grep`, `cat`, `more`, `less`, `cut`, `awk` and `tail` - and piping of course. (and a wave to `awk` and `sed`) 
 
 ## Day 9 
Looking at open ports with with `ss`, and a nod to `netstat`, install `nmap` and test. Install `ufw`, set up, enable and test etc. Discuss security resonsibilities as the sysadmin.
 
 ## Day 10
 Covering `cron`, `at`, and systemd timers
 
 ## Day 11 
Finding things with: `locate`, `find`, `grep`, `which`

## Day 12 

SFTP, the technology, clients, and copying up and down

## Day 13
Permissions, users, groups, (ACLS and SELinux in the Extension)

## Day 14
Using `adduser`, `visudo` to setup up a restricted "helper" to manage our host

## Day 15
Repositories in more detail, how to enable "Multiverse", the role of PPAs in Ubuntu, enabling and installing from them

## Day 16
Understanding and using `tar` and `gzip`

## Day 17
Installing from source. Discussion, using `wget` to get a tarball, `tar` to extract and then configure, make and install. Discussion of security, maintenance issues.

## Day 18
Log management and rotation, `logrotate`

## Day 19
Inodes, hard links symlinks and `stat`
 
 ## Day 20
Understanding how scripting work in Linux, the shebang, permissons and $PATH. A couple of simple sample scripts based on the filtering of logs we've been doing. Resources to explore further.
